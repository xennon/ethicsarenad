   <!--story here-->
 <p>
I stared into the distance and gazed on the mountains. I am looking at the person I love when I look out over the sands. I needed the deserts help to turn into the wind. 
   </p><br><p>
“I’ll give you my sands to help the wind blow, but, alone, I can’t do anything. You have to ask for help from the wind.” The desert told me. 
</p><br><p>
A breeze began to blow as the Chief and his men watch, I could see the alchemist smile. The wind approached me and touched my face. It knew about my conversation with the desert because the wind knows all.
     </p><br><p>
“Help me,” I said “One day you carried the voice of my loved one to me.”
     </p><br><p>
“Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and wind?” The wind asked. 
     </p><br><p>
“My heart,” I answered. The wind and I are very similar I have learned from the alchemist that inside me is the wind and the desert. Even the ocean and the stars are inside me; everything created in the universe is inside me. If the wind could just teach me to be the wind for a few moments I could teach it about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds. I have aroused the winds curiosity because it wanted to talk of those things but it had no idea how to turn a man into the wind. 
</p><br><p>
“In my travels around the world, I’ve often seen people speaking of love and looking toward the heavens,” The wind said, “Maybe it’s better to ask heaven.”
</p><br><p>
“Well then, help me do that,” I said “Fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to heaven.”
The wind blew harder than I have ever felt before. Sand surrounded me as I raised my voice to the sky. The sun turned into nothing more but a golden disk. The chief and his men watched on as I began. The men of the desert were familiar with this wind. They call it simum; and it is worse than a storm at sea. Some said to the Chief they should put an end to this. 
</p><br><p>
“I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the Chief said, with respect. “I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”
</p><br><p>
I continued “The wind told me that you know about love,” I said to the sun. “If you know about love, you must also know about the Soul of the world, because it’s made of love.”
</p><br><p>
Anxiously waiting for a reply I stood my ground with my eyes locked on the golden disk that is the sun. Something that used to be blindingly bright I am now able to stare directly at. I have no fear of anything else. I feel powerful, I feel like the wind. Taking every word the sun said I tell the sun he does not know about love. The sun began to shine more brightly so the wind enjoying the conversation blew harder so I would not be blinded by the sun. The sun questioned why I say it does not know love.
“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to roam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World.” I explained to the sun.
The sun questioned why I wanted him. I explained I need the sun's help to turn me into the wind. He explained to me that he did not know how to turn me into the wind. I asked who I should ask. The sun thought for a moment and then replied, “Speak to the hand that wrote it all.”
</p><br><p>
The wind blew even harder and screamed with delight. I turned to the hand that wrote it all, the universe had fallen silent and I decided not to speak. I started to pray. I prayed like I never have before. It was not a prayer for my sheep or words of pleas. In the silence I understood. I reached through the Soul of the World; I saw that it was a part of the Soul of God, and understood that I a boy could perform miracles. At that moment I became the wind.
